# 🧰 Simple Nginx Web App Deployment on EC2 using GitHub Actions

This is a beginner-friendly DevOps project that deploys a static HTML page to an Nginx web server on an AWS EC2 instance using GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- ✅ Launches an EC2 instance using Terraform
- ✅ Installs Nginx on Amazon Linux 2
- ✅ Serves a simple HTML homepage
- ✅ Uses GitHub Actions to deploy via SSH

## 🏗️ EC2 Infrastructure

This project assumes an EC2 instance is already created. You can:

- ✅ Manually create an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2, with public IP)
- 🔧 Or provision infrastructure using Terraform from this repo: [terraform-aws-infra](https://github.com/abhi2692/terraform-aws-infra.git)

Make sure you:

- Allow inbound HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22)
- Upload the public key of your SSH keypair to EC2
- Store the private key in your GitHub repo secrets

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

```
simple-nginx-deploy/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── deploy.yml         # GitHub Actions workflow
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.sh              # Script to SSH and configure EC2 instance
├── app/
│   └── index.html             # HTML page served by Nginx
└── README.md
```


## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Terraform launches an EC2 instance (not included in this repo).
2. HTML file is pushed to GitHub.
3. GitHub Actions triggers `deploy.yml`.
4. `deploy.sh` connects to EC2 via SSH and:
   - Installs Nginx
   - Sets up the homepage
   - Starts the service

## 🔐 Secrets Required in GitHub

Set the following GitHub Secrets:

- `EC2_SSH_KEY` – Your EC2 private key (in OpenSSH format)
- `EC2_HOST` – Public IP of your EC2 instance
- `EC2_USER` – SSH user, usually `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux 2

## 🏁 To Deploy

Push to the `main` branch. GitHub Actions will do the rest.
